# GrabRedditFront
A Python script that grabs the first 25 links hosted by imgur or reddit from a reddit subreddit.
# How To 
Just change the parameter to the grabRedditFront function to the subreddit that you want to grab the front page imgur links from. Currently set to
http://www.reddit.com/r/earthporn so that I can grab landscape backgrounds for my desktop roll. The images will be downloaded to
whatever directory the GrabRedditFront.py is in.
